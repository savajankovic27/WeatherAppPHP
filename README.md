How to run:

I made this on MacOS, so I only have an approximate idea of how to run it on there, which is the following:

1. Make sure you have homebrew installed.
2. Get PHP onto the laptop (can be done through the terminal), I've done this by putting brew install php into the terminal.
3. Now just run it by typing php -S localhost:8000 into the terminal.
4. To see it in action, just run the local host on your laptop, so for example for me I placed it on 8000 as it was the only available intuitive server on the mac, and have therefore searched: http://localhost:8000/.

As for the API key, you can generate yours on https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys.
